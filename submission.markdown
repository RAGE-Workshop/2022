## Workshop format
The workshop will include the following three types of contributions:
    - Submissions of workshop papers, which will be peer-reviewed by the workshop’s technical program committee. Accepted papers will be presented with an envisioned time slot of 10 minutes for the talk and 5 minutes for the Q&A. 
    - Invited talks from high-end expert speakers from both academia and industry, with an envisioned time slot for each presentation of 20-30 minutes including the Q&A.
    - An open panel discussion that will include experts both from academia and industry to further support the discussion and community building in the workshop.

All invited speakers will participate in the panel discussion. The panel discussion will feature 8 invited panelists and it will be coordinated by the co-chairs of this workshop.

We plan for an 8 hours’ workshop. 

## Submission Instructions

The workshop follows a double-blind peer-review process. The body of each submitted paper will be limited to 4 pages of content, including the bibliography and acknowledgments. Shorter submissions are also welcome. Submissions must comply with the IEEE conference papers guidelines, i.e., 10pt font, with default line-spacing and margins. Templates are available at IEEE templates.
When using the LaTeX template, the document class declaration should look as follows:

```\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}```

## Journal Special Issue
A selection of papers from the accepted submissions are planned to be invited to submit an extended journal version. In these days, we are working to organize the special issue. Invited speakers are also welcome to submit a contribution related to the talk they will deliver. 

## Awards
The organizers will select a shortlist of TPC members for a sub-committee aimed at evaluating the Best Paper Award and the Best Presentation Award of the workshop (for presentations from the open call for paper).
