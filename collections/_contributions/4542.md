    "In this paper, we present a conceptual proposal for a novel predictable and cognitive edge-cloud computing architecture for industrial cyber-physical systems. Timing predictability in this multi-layer architecture is envisioned to be supported by cognitive adaptation mechanisms in various computing layers of the edge-cloud computing continuum, including the communication among the layers. We also discuss our preliminary plan for realizing the proposed architecture. Furthermore, we conceptualize the proposed architecture on a use case from the automation industry to show its applicability."
