    "This paper presents a management toolchain approach for automotive real-time Kubernetes clusters in the mobile edge cloud. As part of a vehicle-centric approach to future mobility it is positioned to extend, offload and enhance the computational capabilities for real-time tasks by exploiting the similarities between the vehicle and a decentralised mobile edge cloud, equipped with sensor systems. By using the same hardware architecture as basis for further improvement of real-time driving tasks, additional steps towards rapid development, robustness and safety of both systems can be achieved. With the help of a prototype, we show the feasibility in principle and how such a system can be realised. A further timing analysis shows the current time constraints. In addition, the prototype is shown to fit into the overall concept as part of the mobile edge cloud of future automotive systems."
